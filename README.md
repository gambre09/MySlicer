# MySlicer
Slicer software AI implemented.
Phase 1: Planning, Foundation, and Initial Scope Definition1. Refine Your Core Vision & Initial Features:○ You have the overarching vision (AI 3D printing software) and a "moonshot" feature(text-to-3D).○ Crucially, define 1-2 more achievable AI features to start with. Text-to-3Dprintable models is cutting-edge research and likely requires significant efort orreliance on external services. Starting with features like "Basic Print FailureDetection (e.g., spaghetti)" or "Automated Optimal Support Placement" will allowyou to build your AI pipeline and integration strategy faster.○ Prioritize the AI features based on impact and feasibility.○ Specifically for Text-to-3D: Research the current landscape. Decide if you will:■ Leverage existing Text-to-3D APIs (e.g., from commercial services likeMeshy, or potentially open-source models like OpenAI's Point-E or newerdifusion-based methods if you have compute resources). This is likely themost practical starting point.■ Attempt to build/fine-tune a Text-to-Image model followed by an Image-to-3Dreconstruction model yourself (very data and compute intensive).■ Focus on text-guided procedural generation for specific object types (e.g.,customizable mugs based on text parameters like volume, handle type). Thisis more limited but potentially easier to control printability.○ Acknowledge that the output of text-to-3D models (especially from APIs) mayrequire significant post-processing to be truly 3D printable (mesh repair, ensuringmanifold geometry, checking thickness, etc.).2. Choose Your Technology Stack (Confirmed C++/Python Hybrid):○ C++ Core: For performance-critical tasks (Mesh loading, slicing, geometryoperations, path planning, G-code generation).○ Python Layer: For GUI, AI/ML model training and inference, data handling, APIinteractions, settings management, higher-level workflow.○ Binding Technology: Select a library like pybind11 (highly recommended) orBoost.Python to allow your Python code to call C++ functions and pass databetween the two.○ GUI Framework: Choose a Python GUI library (e.g., PyQt/PySide, Kivy, Tkinter).○ Geometry Libraries: Select libraries for C++ (e.g., CGAL for complex operations,or simpler custom code for basic mesh manipulation) and Python (e.g., trimesh,numpy/scipy for numerical/geometric tasks).○ AI/ML Frameworks: Standard Python libraries (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch,scikit-learn, OpenCV).○ Version Control: Set up Git.○ Development Environment: Choose IDEs (VS Code with extensions, PyCharmPro, Visual Studio), compilers, etc.3. Set Up Project Structure:○ Create a repository with clear separation between C++ code (e.g., core/), Pythoncode (e.g., app/, ai/), data (e.g., data/), documentation, etc.○ Configure build systems (e.g., CMake for C++ with Python binding setup) anddependency management (e.g., pip for Python).Phase 2: Core Software Development (Build the Backbone)This phase involves building the fundamental non-AI parts of your software, which arenecessary to even test AI features.1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Implement Mesh Loading and Representation (C++):○ Expand on your basic binary STL loader. Add support for ASCII STL and ideally3MF (which can include more data like color, material, and scene info).○ Create a robust mesh data structure (using indexed vertices is more memoryeficient than duplicated vertices in binary STL).○ Implement basic mesh cleaning and validation (checking for manifold geometry,fixing flipped normals if possible).Develop the Slicing Engine (C++):○ Implement the core slicing algorithm (intersecting mesh triangles with Z planes).Refine the intersection logic for robustness (handling edge cases, floating-pointprecision).○ Generate raw layer geometries (contours).○ Implement algorithms to stitch raw segments into ordered closed polygons(contours). Identify outer and inner contours.Implement Basic Toolpath Generation (C++):○ Based on contours, generate simple toolpaths (e.g., printing perimeters).○ Implement basic movement commands (G0/G1) and extrusion calculations.○ Generate simple G-code output for a target printer firmware (e.g., Marlin).Build Basic Python Application Structure & GUI:○ Create the main application window using your chosen GUI framework.○ Implement file loading/saving functionality (calling your C++ mesh loader viabindings).○ Create a basic 3D view to display the loaded model (can use visualization libraries).○ Add controls for basic slicing settings (layer height, number of perimeters).○ Call the C++ slicing engine via bindings and display the resulting layers/toolpaths(basic preview).Implement C++/Python Bindings:○ Use pybind11 to expose the necessary C++ classes (Mesh, Slicer functions) toPython. Ensure data structures (like Vec3, Triangle, Mesh, Layer, Segment) can bepassed or accessed correctly between languages.Phase 3: Data Collection and Preparation for Initial AI Features1. Plan and Execute Data Collection for Initial AI Feature(s):○ Based on the 1-2 AI features you chose in Step 1, implement the data collectionmechanisms.○ For Print Failure Detection (Image-based):■ Set up cameras focused on the print bed.■ Implement code to capture images/video frames at regular intervals duringprints.■ Log corresponding print data (timestamp, G-code line number, current speed,temp, layer, etc.).○ For Parameter Optimization/Prediction:■ Ensure your software logs all slicing settings, printer parameters used, andideally, environmental conditions for every print.■ Develop a system to record the outcome (manual feedback: successful/failed,notes on quality; or automated: using metrics like print time, weight, maybeimage analysis of the final part).○ Run numerous prints with varying settings and models to generate diverse datacovering diferent scenarios and outcomes.2. Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Labeling:○ Build scripts/tools (likely in Python) to process the collected raw data.○ Clean data (handle missing values, outliers).○ Format data appropriately for your chosen AI models (e.g., resize images, parse logfiles into structured features).○ Crucially: Label your data. This will likely require significant manual efort,especially for failure detection (reviewing images/videos) or quality ratings. Developclear labeling guidelines.Phase 4: AI Development (Initial Features)1. Choose and Implement AI Models for Initial Features:○ Select appropriate model architectures using Python ML frameworks.○ For Failure Detection (Image-based): A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) isstandard.○ For Parameter Optimization/Prediction: Regression models (to predict a valuelike optimal speed) or classification models (to predict success/failure) usinglibraries like scikit-learn or basic neural networks.2. Train and Evaluate AI Models:○ Split your labeled datasets into training, validation, and test sets.○ Train your models using the training data. Monitor performance on the validationset.○ Tune hyperparameters to improve performance and prevent overfitting.○ Evaluate the final model performance on the unseen test set using appropriatemetrics. Iterate on model architecture, data, and training until performance issatisfactory.Phase 5: Integration of Initial AI Features1. Integrate Trained AI Models into the Python Layer:○ Load the trained models into your Python application using the framework'sinference APIs.○ For Failure Detection: Create a pipeline where captured images (or extractedfeatures from images) are fed to the loaded model in real-time or near-real-timeduring a print. The model outputs a prediction (e.g., probability of failure).○ For Parameter Optimization: Create logic where, based on user input (material,desired outcome), your application passes relevant data to the model, which returnsrecommended settings.2. Implement Application Logic Based on AI Output:○ For Failure Detection: Based on the model's prediction (e.g., failure probabilityexceeds a threshold), trigger an action in the Python GUI (display alert, sound,send notification). Potentially, call a C++ function (exposed via bindings) to pause orcancel the print by sending commands to the printer (requires printercommunication implementation).○ For Parameter Optimization: Populate the slicing settings UI with therecommended values from the AI model. Allow the user to accept or modify them.Phase 6: Tackling the Text-to-3D Feature (Iterative Process)1. Research and Select Text-to-3D Approach(es): Revisit your initial research (from Step1) and make a concrete decision based on the maturity of available tools/APIs and yourresources. Leveraging an existing API is highly recommended for initialimplementation.2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Integrate Text-to-3D API/Model (If Using External Service):○ Sign up for the service and obtain API keys.○ Write Python code to interact with the API: format text prompts, send requests,handle responses.○ The API will return 3D model data (likely in a common format like STL, OBJ, orGLB).○ Receive this data in your Python layer.Integrate Text-to-3D Model (If Running Locally):○ Obtain the pre-trained model weights and necessary inference code (likely inPython).○ Ensure dependencies are compatible.○ Write Python code to load the model and run inference using the text prompt.○ The model will output some 3D representation (mesh, point cloud, NeRFparameters). You'll need code to convert this to a standard mesh format (STL,3MF).Post-Processing of Generated 3D Models:○ This is crucial for printability. The generated mesh will likely have issues.○ Load the generated 3D data into your robust C++ mesh structure (from Step 4).○ Implement or integrate C++ libraries for mesh repair (e.g., fixing holes, makingmanifold).○ Potentially implement checks for features like wall thickness or overhangs. Providefeedback to the user.Integrate into Python GUI:○ Add a text input field for the user prompt.○ Add a button to trigger the text-to-3D generation process (calling your Python APIinteraction or local inference code).○ Display the generated 3D model in the preview window using your visualizationcapabilities. Allow users to manipulate it.Refine Prompting & Generation: Experiment with diferent text prompts and APIparameters to improve the quality and relevance of generated models (e.g., adding detailslike "solid," "manifold," "with a flat base" to prompts).Phase 7: Testing, Refinement, Deployment, and Maintenance1. 2. 3. Comprehensive Testing:○ Test the core C++ slicing engine with various complex models.○ Test the Python GUI and user workflows.○ Test the integration points between C++ and Python.○ Test the AI features rigorously with diverse data, including edge cases.○ Test the Text-to-3D pipeline end-to-end: from text input, through generation,post-processing, slicing, and ideally, actual printing of the result to check printability.Refinement and Optimization:○ Optimize performance of both C++ (slicing speed, memory usage) and Python (AIinference speed, GUI responsiveness).○ Improve the accuracy and robustness of your AI models based on testing feedback.○ Refine the user interface and overall workflow.Deployment:○ Package your software (C++ executable/library, Python code, AI model files) fordistribution across target platforms.○ Consider how users will manage model updates.4. Monitoring and Maintenance:○ Plan for collecting anonymous usage data and AI performance metrics (with userconsent).○ Set up a system for users to report issues or provide feedback on AI performance(especially for text-to-3D).○ Continuously gather more data to retrain and improve AI models over time.○ Release updates as you enhance features and models.
